we keep track of the memory allocated or taken up by mymalloc with the static var memAllocated

if the MemEntry gets destroyed then memAllocated gets deleted
--however if the data is freed but the MemEntry is not destroyed
-ie MemEntry in middle, and user deleted
  -memAllocated is not updated because the MemEntry is still in use

-If two freed blocks in a row
 -get rid of second memStruct and size
 -add to size in first memStruct the size of a memStruct + size of data stored in second memStruct


 When freeing
 -check if blocks on either side are free
 -if free then combine them

Basically add new MemEntrys to end of list
-this allows us to add on to the end
