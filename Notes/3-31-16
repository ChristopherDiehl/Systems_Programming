how to handle stuf:


directory_handle(char * name)
{
	to get list of everything inside directory, use dirent
	opendir - opens directory
	readdir - gets object in directory
	so:
	opendir(name)
	while (readdir != 0){
		test dirent for null
		if dirent != null: get type of entry:

		if entry is a file: call file handle
		if directory: call directory_handle
	}
}

file_handler(char * name)
{
	essentially call tokenizer and add tokenized contents to list.	
}
