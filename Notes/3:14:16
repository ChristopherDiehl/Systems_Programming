Difference between fopen and open

Blocking call, blocks everything in process until function is completed

BANK

-Input, tokenize to find words.. Then 

-can't debit or finish before opened

Server processing:

client machine: 
	-client code: connect to server
		can't find server.. Retry until server comes up
		-need to specify port and ip of server
		-once connected state connected
		-accept user input in a loop
			-'exit' close connection and shut down instance of client code
			accept commands read from stdin

server side:
	- connection from multiple clients
	-one big bank store
		-perhaps a struct with multiple 'accounts' structs
		-probably want to mutex an account struct

	-Max of 20 accounts
	-Account name = 100 char
	-Current balance = floating point

	backup simulation:
	-every twenty seconds, lock everyone out and print out account name and balances for everyone
		-if account in session: print in session
	-possible bank wide mutex
	-need a timer
		-can combine timer and mutex
		-called a timer mechanism
		-Signal handler 
	-special signal for a timer
		-getitimer & setitimer
			-throws a sig alarm
			-catch signal handler
			-don't change anything except global data

	-DONT USE BANKWIDE MUTEX.. JUST USE SIG HANDLER
	-need to inspect account mutex, need to know it's current state
		-use trylock
			-non blocking mutex call
			-problem is it locks if unlocked
	-or just make an account global variable, active
		-if active==1 then in session
	-client can only send message every 2 seconds... Take that 
	-look at his server template

	sockfd = socket(AF_INTE,SOCK_STREAM,0);
	if(sockfd<0)
	{
		error("error opening socket");
	}

	struct to define address 
	-addressInfoStruct
	listen(sockfd,5)

server:
	create socket construct/type
		setup addressinfo
	
	bind socket to a port

	listen for connections

	accept connection
		-blocking call
	/*same in java*/

	bzero(buffer,256)

	n = read(newsockfd,buffer,255)
	//http://www.binarytides.com/socket-programming-c-linux-tutorial/

	socket stays in use for five minutes when creating socket with 0
	-need to set some socket options

	SO_REUSEPORT
	-basically shuts down old port then 
	SO_LINGER
	-shuts down socket on program exit
	...
	SO_REUSEADDR?

client:
	create socket construct type
		setup addresssinfo
		gethostbyname for IP address
		itoa on port.. htons on int to get it into 'port' format
		connect- try to talk to IP address


read/write from/to a socket
	-everything is good
	-error
	if you block on read, can't accept new connections
