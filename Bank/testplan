- run the server : Test using 2 clients : 
client 1  // RUN this first 
	open acc1 
	credit 10000
	try to open acc2 without closing acc1 session.
		> This is give out an error telling us to close the session
	finish acc1
	try to find balance of acc1 
		> This should give out error saying session has to be opened 
	open acc4
	call balance :	
		> This should give us 0
	debit 100
		> Balance should increase by 100
	credit 100
		> Balance should increase by 100
	debit -10000
		> This should say insufficient funds
	balance 
		> print out 200	
	finish > ends sssion
	exit

Test2:

client 2
	open acc1
		> should give error telling it already exist
	open acc3
	credit 1000
	credit -100
	debit 0
	debit -100
	close acc3 
server :


client 1:
	open an account
	exit immediately 
	> Testing the turning on and shutting down of the clinet 


Test 3:



client 1
	open a1
	start a1
		> Should say session already active
	balance 
		> 0
	credit 100
		> add bal by 100
	debit 100
		> add bal by 100
	debit -1000	
		> Insufficient fund warning
	credit -1000
	
	open a2
		> Should say close session first
	
	balance
		
	finish
	exit

client 2 // after clinet 1 has opened a1
	open a1
		> should say acc already exist
	start a1
		> should start acc as clinet 1 has stopped using it
	finish a1
	
	open a3 
		> works
	balance
		> 0
	credit -100000000
		> bal changes

	finish 
	exit


Test 4:


In order to test the simpleList:
start a bunch of threads -> add pthread to simpleList -> pull from simple list to join

Test 5:
In order to test client 
	
	-try connecting to server -> should keep trying to connect if failed
	-try closing server using control+c to make sure its handled ->should result in normal exit
	-try to exit from the client ->should result in a timely exit

Test 6:
In order to test the server
	-try to control + c server with no clients-> nicely exit
	-try to control + c server with clients -> wait for client read to finish, then exit gracefully
	-try to connect and read / write to multiple clients at the same time

Test 7:
IN order to test bank logic

	-try to access multiple user accounts while logged in-> denied
	-try to access active account ->denied
	-try to open account after 20 accounts have been opened ->denied
	-try to debit more than in account -> denied
	- try to start another account after open ->denied
	- try to open and add 50 to account through credit ->accepted and balance == 50
	- try to open and add 50 to account through debit ->accepted and balance == 50
	- try to start and add 50 to account through credit ->accepted and balance += 50
	- try to finish then reopen ->allows reopen as long as account is not active 
	-try to open account already open then check balance -> fails and then told to open session
	-the standard add / subtract debit and credit -> debit fails when the amount sent to server causes balance to fall below 0. rest goes through
	-start account in use ->fail
	-finish then balance ->fail
	-tested with 5 clients at once.
	-try to start an account then open it ->fail because once you start you cannot open until you finish
	-try to finish then open ->succeed
